## All emails use inline styles for CSS.
* Style elements *may* work sometimes, but it is best in emails to use inline styles.
* External stylesheets almost never work in emails, so please just use inlining tools when composing emails.
* *(Soon)* There is an inline tool that you can use built into the `email.py` document that you can use to inline CSS into the HTML, then it returns the HTML as a string.
